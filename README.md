In this Solidity project, I developed a Smart Contract that simulates a letter of credit.
In this model, we have one Exporter and the Issuing Bank, which deploys the SC on the buyer's request. Documents must be submitted by the exporter and validated by the Issuing Bank.
This code was developed for a Master's Degree project about Blockchain in International Commerce (https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146956/3/tribabTFM0622memoria.pdf)
