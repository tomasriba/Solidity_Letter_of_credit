In this Solidity project, I developed a Smart Contract that simulates a letter of credit, reducing costs and time.

The model has one Exporter and the Issuing Bank, which deploys the Smart Contract on the buyer's request. The documents must be encrypted using IFPS and submitted by the exporter, so the Issuing Bank can validate them.

This code was developed for a Master's Degree project about Blockchain in International Commerce (https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146956/3/tribabTFM0622memoria.pdf)
