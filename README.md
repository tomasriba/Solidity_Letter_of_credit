In this Solidity project, I have developed a Smart Contract that simulates a letter of credit, aiming to reduce costs and time.

The model has one Exporter and the Issuing Bank, which deploys the Smart Contract on the buyer's request. The contract assigns two public keys, one for the issuing bank and another for the exporter, so they can interact with the contract. The documents must be encrypted using IFPS and submitted by the exporter, so the Issuing Bank can validate them.

This code was developed for a Master's Degree project about Blockchain in International Commerce (https://openaccess.uoc.edu/bitstream/10609/146956/3/tribabTFM0622memoria.pdf)
